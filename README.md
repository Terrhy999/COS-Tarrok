# Tarokka Card 

## Description 
This is a web program designed to help a Dungeon Master give a Tarokka Card reading for the popular Dungeons and Dragons campaign Curse Of Strahd. It allows the user to perform the reading in person with a standarad 52 card deck, and have the results displayed online.

Each card in a standard 52 card deck corresponds to a specific Tarokka Card from the Curse of Strahd Campaign Book, each with a unique fortune. The user selects 5 cards, either from a list of a standard 52 card deck or from the Tarokka deck. Then you can flip over the 5 selected cards to reveal them, and display the associated fortune of that card. Revealed by the click of a button is the fortune's information for the Dungeon Master.
