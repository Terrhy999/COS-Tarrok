This man is more than he seems.,"This card refers to Rictavio (see appendix D), who can be found at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, Rictavio changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten. The characters might think that Gadof Blinsky, the toymaker of Vallaki (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are “old friends,” but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines.

If the characters cast a raise dead spell or a resurrection spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human noble) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife’s protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia. If the characters don’t have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, Rictavio (see appendix D) gives them a spell scroll of raise dead if he learns of their need.
